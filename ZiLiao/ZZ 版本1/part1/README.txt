Put memory in a txt format using integer at each line. Or you can also use the test file we upload. Make sure the file path is "F:\\Instruction.txt".Launch the app, and you can see a UI.When you click the Button "Run", the instructions will be executed until the simulator read a HLT instruction. However, when you click the Button "Op by Op", the instructions will work one by one, so you need to click this button more times. The Button "Restart" is for you to initialize the memory and registers.The Button "Singlestep" is for you to see every steps in one instruction.Now our group have finished only two instructures LDR and STR. In the future, we will finish all of the instructures.
